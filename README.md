## Introduction

Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, is a critical issue for businesses across various industries. It refers to the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a company or service. High churn rates can significantly impact revenue, profitability, and growth. This project leverages the power of **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)** to develop a robust predictive model for customer churn, enabling businesses to proactively identify at-risk customers and implement targeted retention strategies. ANNs are particularly well-suited for capturing complex, non-linear relationships within data, which is often characteristic of customer behavior.

## Problem Statement

Businesses face a significant challenge in retaining customers. Without effective churn prediction mechanisms, companies often react too late, leading to lost customers and revenue. The goal is to build a highly accurate and robust predictive model using ANNs that can identify customers likely to churn based on their historical behavior and demographic information, thereby allowing for timely interventions.

## Project Goals

- To explore and understand the customer churn dataset.
- To preprocess the data, handling missing values, outliers, and categorical features, specifically preparing it for an ANN.
- To perform comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights into churn drivers.
- To engineer relevant features that can improve ANN performance.
- To design, build, train, and optimize an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for churn prediction.
- To evaluate the ANN model's performance rigorously using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC).
- To provide actionable insights that can inform business strategies for customer retention.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [**Specify your dataset source here, e.g., Kaggle, a company database, UCI Machine Learning Repository**]. It contains information about [**briefly describe what the dataset contains, e.g., telecom customer behavior, bank customer data, subscription service data**].

**Example Dataset Description (if applicable):**
The dataset contains information on 7,043 customers and includes 21 features related to their demographics, account details, and billing information.

## Features

The dataset includes a variety of features that can be broadly categorized as:

-   **Demographic Information:** Gender, SeniorCitizen, Partner, Dependents
-   **Account Information:** Tenure, PhoneService, MultipleLines, InternetService, OnlineSecurity, OnlineBackup, DeviceProtection, TechSupport, StreamingTV, StreamingMovies, Contract, PaperlessBilling, PaymentMethod
-   **Billing Information:** MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges
-   **Target Variable:** Churn (Yes/No)

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/customer-churn-prediction-ann.git](https://github.com/your-username/customer-churn-prediction-ann.git)
    cd customer-churn-prediction-ann
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    (Ensure your `requirements.txt` includes `tensorflow` or `keras`, `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, etc.)

## Usage

After installation, you can run the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts to reproduce the analysis and model training.

1.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd customer-churn-prediction-ann
    ```

2.  **Start Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    This will open Jupyter in your web browser, where you can navigate to and run the `notebooks/` files (e.g., `1_Data_Preprocessing_EDA.ipynb`, `2_ANN_Model_Training.ipynb`).

3.  **Alternatively, run Python scripts:**
    If you have `.py` scripts for different stages, you can run them from the terminal:
    ```bash
    python src/data_preprocessing.py
    python src/ann_model_training.py
    ```

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing

-   Handling missing values (e.g., `TotalCharges`).
-   Converting data types where necessary (e.g., `TotalCharges` to numeric).
-   **One-Hot Encoding** for nominal categorical variables (crucial for ANNs).
-   **Label Encoding** for ordinal categorical variables (if any).
-   **Feature Scaling (Standardization or Normalization)** of numerical features (e.g., `StandardScaler`, `MinMaxScaler`) â€“ **essential for ANN performance** to prevent larger feature values from dominating the learning process.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

-   Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis of features.
-   Visualization of distributions, relationships, and churn rates across different features (e.g., histograms, bar plots, box plots, scatter plots).
-   Identifying potential correlations and insights into churn behavior.

### Feature Engineering

-   Creating new features from existing ones if beneficial (e.g., `MonthlyChargePerTenure`).
-   Consider interaction terms if EDA suggests strong non-linear relationships.

### Model Selection (Focus on ANN)

While traditional ML models might be used for baseline comparison, the primary focus is on **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)** due to their capability to learn complex patterns.

### ANN Architecture & Training

-   **Model Architecture:**
    -   Defining the number of layers (hidden layers).
    -   Determining the number of neurons in each layer.
    -   Choosing appropriate activation functions (e.g., `ReLU` for hidden layers, `Sigmoid` for the output layer in binary classification).
-   **Input Layer:** Number of neurons equal to the number of input features after preprocessing.
-   **Output Layer:** 1 neuron with a `sigmoid` activation function for binary classification (churn/no churn).
-   **Loss Function:** `binary_crossentropy` for binary classification.
-   **Optimizer:** Choosing an optimizer (e.g., `Adam`, `RMSprop`, `SGD`) and configuring its learning rate.
-   **Batch Size & Epochs:** Determining appropriate values for training stability and convergence.
-   **Regularization:** Applying techniques like L1/L2 regularization or Dropout to prevent overfitting.
-   **Callbacks:** Using `EarlyStopping` to prevent overfitting and `ModelCheckpoint` to save the best model.

### Model Evaluation

-   Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
-   Training the ANN model on the training data.
-   Evaluating model performance using metrics such as:
    -   Accuracy
